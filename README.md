## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Blender or equivalent
- Make sure that you are using Unreal 4.26.2 or above

## The Problem

We have two environments (Plaza and Lounge) and need to connect the two areas with a liminal space. We do not have any concept art for this area and need you to extrapolate the style of the two environments into an area that naturally connects the two.

This will need to be modelled and textured in your preferred tools (Blender is a bonus) and brought into Unreal Engine for rendering, lighting and then finally submission.

## The Goal

The goal of this test is to show your ability to take an existing style and extrapolate that concept effectively into a undefined space. This is also intended as an opportunity for you to showcase your hard surface modelling, texturing and lighting capabilities.

This is not intended to be a complex feature rich environment, more so something simple that both connects and compliments the two existing spaces.

The total time spent on this test should be no more than 2 days.

## Requirements

- Submitted as an Unreal Engine Project file in addition to source files for your respective modelling/texturing software
- Light baking and reflections to be carried out in UE4
- Clean topology, low poly
- Ensure the materials respect PBR values
- 2k texture limit

## Bonuses

- Use of RMA materials
- Use of trim sheet textures
- Organise assets and folders as you would normally

## Submission

To submit your work please upload the relevant files (FBXs, Substance, Blender files, Unreal files, TGAs) to WeTransfer or GDrive. Once ready please share with [Raoul](mailto:raoul@virtexstadium.com)
